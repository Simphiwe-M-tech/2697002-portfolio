        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>A computer science student who is studying at the university of the Witwatersrand and who loves problem solving. Interested into furthering my studies and do an honours in cybersecurity.
           I love the field as it is fascinating and allows one to be flex in terms of switching from one field to another. cyber crime is a very seroius matter and people use it to steal people's hardwork and destroy live, so I would love to contribute in securing the internet. I also love working with data, finding useful insight with data is just good. I Did not know how useful data can be and how helpful it is in creating models that can predict future outcomes in business.</p>
           <p>Data science is the second field i am interest in getting into. It is great</p>
