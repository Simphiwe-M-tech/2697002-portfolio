        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>As a student doing computer science, it very important to keep the skills we learn active as there is so many concepts that we work on. So actively building projects is the best way to keep your self from forgetting those important skills.
            Below are some of the projects I built for course work and during my sparetime.
