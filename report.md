I have learned that as a student doing computer science it is importart to know how to use Git and Github, because it helps when I am working with a team, we can collaborate and make changes to our project without causing problems to the original project.
Git is free and open source that is hosted on my computer, enables me to manage and review my code.
Git is hosted on my computer and Github is the platform that hosts the repository of the project of Git.
I can clone my main branch and work on that and if i am satisfied with the changes, then I can merge it to the original repository.
